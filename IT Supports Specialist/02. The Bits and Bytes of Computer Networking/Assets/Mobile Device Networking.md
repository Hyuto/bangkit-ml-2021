# Mobile Device Networks

## Internet of Things Protocols

Some mobile devices are what we call [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) **devices**. These devices communicate with each other using Wi-Fi, and/or IoT network protocols. Some of these IoT network protocols are [Z-Wave](https://z-wavealliance.org/about_z-wave_technology/), [ZigBee](https://zigbee.org/zigbee-for-developers/zigbee-3-0/), and [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread).

## Bluetooth Pairing

Mobile devices connect to their peripherals using short-range wireless networks. The most common short range wireless network is called [Bluetooth](https://www.bluetooth.com/). Pairing devices : The two devices exchange information, sometimes including a PIN or password, so that they can remember each other. From then on, the devices will automatically connect to each other when they're both powered on and in range. Pairing devices like this can sometimes fail, and you might need to make your device forget the peripheral, so it can be paired again.
